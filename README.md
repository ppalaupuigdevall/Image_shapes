ppp_test_ransac2d.m 

  This script computes the RANSAC method to fit a line in the 2D space (a picture). It uses ransacfitlines2d function to do it, this          function was originally created by Peter Kovesi, I just adapted it for the 2 dimensional case. Tested with   the image provided both in    the repository and the script.

ppp_rotation_angle.m 
  
  This script computes the Hough transform and applies some post processing to detect rotation in images. Tested with rotated_building.png.
